<b>Summary</b>

This project is meant to fulfill the various projects in the Codecademy Full Stack Developer course track. 
Despite Codecademy describing the projects with minimum requirements, I wanted to take them a few steps further by incorporating more advance code and resources.

<b>Version 1</b>

NOTE: "Version 1" is not labeled with a version number. Files included in "Version 1" would be all initially uploaded files in the month of 05/2024. 
This version included only the site's "Home" page and was incomplete when first committed to Github. 

<b>Version 6624a_1</b>
